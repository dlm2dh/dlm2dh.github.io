                    Learning from this feedback, I defined a long-term vision for helping people catch up with changes and shipped an in-document Activity Feed to start enabling people to see what has happened in their documents.</span></p>

                      History is extremely helpful when collaborating with teammates because you have the comfort of knowing your and everyone else's changes are available in a previous version.  Go ahead and try it out on Windows desktop, Windows mobile, and Android devices.</span></p>

We worked closely with the vineyard to understand their pain points and we analyzed their current manual processes to identify opportunities to improve their HR system's efficiency.  As part of the group, I built a web-based Human Resource management system to replace their paper-based system.  This solution enabled our customer to find, add, and update their records in seconds rather than minutes or hours.</span></p>
